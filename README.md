# Machine-Translation-Udacity-NLP
### The final project for Udacity NLP Foundation Nanodegree
This is the final custom implementation of the Udacity NLP Foundation couse, Machine Translation, on a small corpus.
The system gave a final output of `97%` accuracy.
Using `early stop` or `save best model` with a higher epoch count could have improved the final accuracy.

**Note -** The maximum number of word count in the longest sentence is `15 for english`, and `21 for french`. Replace 21 with a 
variable to remove hard coding.
